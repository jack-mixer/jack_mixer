Installation
------------

Read INSTALL for information on installation.


Using MIDI CCs to control jack_mixer
------------------------------------

MIDI CCs can be used to control volume and balance/panorama of channels.

The default controller for main channel volume is 7, and the default for
main channel balance is 8.  Default controllers for added channels are
chosen using predefined algorithm, first free controller starting from 11,
first for volume, next for balance/panorama.

So, if you don't delete channels, you will get CC#11 used for first input
channel volume, CC#12 for first channel balance/panorama, CC#13 for second
channel volume, CC#14 for second channel balance/panorama, etc.

It is also possible to select other CCs when creating the channel, or
afterwards from the channel properties dialog (accessible by double clicking
on the channel name).

MIDI CC values (0-127) are mapped to dBFS using current slider scale for
corresponding channel.
