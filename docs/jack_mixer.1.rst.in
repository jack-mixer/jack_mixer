SYNOPSIS
========

jack_mixer.py [-h] [-c FILE] [-d] [NAME]


DESCRIPTION
===========

This manual page documents the **jack_mixer** command.

**jack_mixer** is a multi-channel audio mixer application for the JACK Audio
Connection Kit with a graphical user interface and has a look & handling similar
to hardware mixing desks.


OPTIONS
=======

Positional arguments:

    NAME                  set JACK client name

Optional arguments:

    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -c FILE, --config FILE
                          load mixer project configuration from FILE
    -d, --debug           enable debug logging messages


GUI USAGE
=========

After starting **jack_mixer**, you need to create at least one input and one
output channel via the respective entries in the "Mixer" menu (see section
**MAIN MENU**).

Then connect your audio sources to the **jack_mixer's** JACK audio input ports
(see section **JACK AUDIO AND MIDI PORTS**) using ``jack_connect`` or GUI tools
like the QJackCtl's connections window, Catia, Carla, etc. Connect the monitor
channel output port(s) or the output ports of the output channels to the input
ports of your audio interface or any other JACK audio input ports.

Then adjust input and output channel volume levels and balance as required using
the fader controls in each channel strip (see section **MOUSE BINDINGS** for
ways to to control the faders and routing).


JACK AUDIO AND MIDI PORTS
-------------------------

* For each input channel, **jack_mixer** will create one (if it is a mono
  channel) or two (stereo) JACK audio input ports. The input port(s) will be
  named like the input channel strip, if it is a mono channel, or with an " L"
  resp. " R" suffix, it it is a stereo channel.

* Optionally, for each input channel, it creates a direct, post-fader audio
  output port (mono) or pair of output ports (stereo). These are named the same
  as their input port(s) with " Out" resp. " Out L" / "Out R" appended.

* For each output channel it will create one (mono) or two (stereo) audio output
  ports.

* Additionally it will create one pair of audio monitor ports named "Monitor L"
  and "Monitor R".

* If **jack_mixer** was compiled with JACK MIDI support, it will also create
  one MIDI input ("midi in") and one MIDI output ("midi out") port.


MAIN MENU
---------

Main Menu:

Use the **Mixer** menu to:

* Add an input or output channel.
* Add an output channel.
* Open a file with a preset mixer layout.
* Save the current mixer layout to an XML file.
* Exit **jack_mixer**.

Use the **Edit** menu to:

* Change the properties of an input or output channel.
* Remove an input or output channel.
* Toggle all channel strips between wide and narrow view.
* Clear the current mixer layout, i.e. remove all input and output channels.
* Open the setting preferences dialog.

Use the **Help** menu to show **jack_mixer's** about dialog.


MOUSE BINDINGS
--------------

Main window:

* Left-click and drag the vertical divider line horizontally to set the size
  distribution of the left and right panels for the input and output channel
  strips. If a panel contains more channel strips than can be fit into its
  horizontal size, horizontal scrollbars will be available at the bottom of
  the panel.

Channel strip header:

* Double click the channel strip header to open the channel properties dialog.
* Ctrl+left-click the channel strip header to toggle the channel strip between
  wide and narrow view.
* Left-click and drag the channel strip header horizontally to re-order
  channel strips. This doesn't effect the order of the JACK output ports
  and input channels are always arranged on the left side of the main
  **jack_mixer** window and output chanels on the right side.

Control groups (input channels):

Each input channel header has a control group for each output channel, which
has the same background color and label as the corresponding output channel
header.

Each output channel control group shows a pre/post-fader ("P") and a mute ("M")
button and, optionally, a solo ("S") button.

* Left-click the pre/post-fader ("P") button to toggle the signal sent to the
  corresponding output channel between the post-fader (off) and pre-fader (on)
  signal of the input channel.
* Left-click the mono ("M") button to mute the signal from the input channel
  going to the corresponding output channel.
* Left-click the solo ("S") button to solo the input channel for the
  corresponding output channel. i.e. only the signal from this input channel
  (plus any other soloed channels) is going to this output channel.

Volume read-out and peak-indicator:

* Left-click the volume level read-out to enter a value manually and press
  Enter to set it.
* Left/right-click the peak volume level read-out to reset the over-zero
  indication.
* Middle-click the peak volume level read-out to set the volume level to
  peak at 0 dB at the current signal input level.

Volume meter:

* Left-click the pre-fader ("PRE") button below the volume meter to switch the
  signal, which is metered, from post-fader (off) to pre-fader (on).

  *(not yet implemented)*

Volume slider:

* Left-click and drag vertically anywhere in the slider area to set the channel
  output volume level.
* Scroll the mouse wheel up or down over the slider area to increase or
  decrease the volume level.
* Right-click anywhere in the slider area to move the volume level slowly
  towards the click position.
* Double click to set the volume level to -inf.
* Ctrl+left-click to set the volume level to 0 dBFS.

Balance slider:

* Left-click and drag horizontally anywhere in the slider area to set the
  balance between the left and right channel of the output signal.
* Scroll the mouse wheel up or down over the slider area to move the
  balance to right or left.
* Right-click anywhere in the slider area to move the balance slowly towards
  the click position.
* Double click to set the left/right balance to center.

Channel buttons:

* Left-click the  mono ("M") button to mute signal from channel going to all
  output channels (including direct channel outs).
* Ctrl+left-click the  mono ("M") button for "exclusive" mute, i.e. the mute
  function will be activated on this input or output channel only and
  deactivated on all other input resp. output channels.
* Left-click the solo ("S") button to solo an input channel, i.e. only the
  signal from this channel is going to all output channels (including the
  direct outputs of the channel).

  The solo function is cumulative, i.e. you can activate solo on more than one
  input channel and the signals from all soloed channels will be going to each
  output channel.

  Output channels have no solo button.
* Ctrl+left-click the solo ("SM") button for "exclusive" solo, i.e. the solo
  function will be activated on this channel only and deactivated on all other
  input channels.
* Right-clicking the mute ("M") button acts like left-clicking but also
  synchronizes the muted state on all output channel control groups of the
  channel with the main channel mute button.

  Output channel control groups, where the mute function was already active
  before righ-clicking the mute button are unaffected, i.e. it will stay
  activated.
* Right-clicking the solo ("S") button acts like left-clicking but also
  synchronizes the soloed state on all output channel control groups of the
  channel with the main channel solo button.

  Output channel control groups, where the solo function was already active
  before righ-clicking the solo button are unaffected, i.e. it will stay
  activated.
* Left-click the monitor ("MON") button, to toggle monitoring. If monitoring
  is on, the (post-fader) signal from the channel is sent to the "Monitor L/R"
  outputs. The monitor function is exclusive, i.e. activating monitoring on a
  channel, will turn off monitoring on any other channel.


COMPATIBILITY
=============

**jack_mixer** is fully compatible with the New Session Manager (NSM) protocol
and provides Level 1 (L1) support for the LADISH protocol. When running as an
NSM client, the mixer layout and current state will be saved in the NSM session.
When started as an L1 client by LADISH, the mixer layout and current state will
be saved in the LADISH studio session or project (the first time LADISH
requests **jack_mixer** to save a project, it will open a "Save as" dialog).


FILES
=====

``<XDG_CONFIG_HOME>/jack_mixer/preferences.ini``
    This file stores global settings for **jack_mixer**.


ENVIRONMENT
===========

``LANGUAGE``, ``LC_ALL``, ``LC_MESSAGES``, and ``LANG``
    The first of these environment variables set to a non-empty value is used
    to determine the language(s) for loading gettext translation files if the
    language is not set in the global settings. The value should be a colon
    separated list of language codes.
``LOCALEDIR``
    With this environment variable, the base directory for the gettext
    translation files can be changed from the default set at compile
    time, which is usually ``<prefix>/share/locale``.
``JACK_MIXER_DEBUG``
    When this environment variable is set, the logging level in the Python
    layer is set to ``DEBUG`` unless it is overwritten by the ``-d|--debug``
    command line switch.
``NSM_URL``
    When this environment variable is set, **jack_mixer** will act as a New
    Session Manager (NSM) session client.


SIGNALS
=======

``SIGUSR1``
    In accordance with Level 1 support of LADISH, **jack_mixer** saves the
    current mixer layout and state on receiving a ``USR1`` signal.
``SIGINT | SIGTERM``
    When receiving an ``INT`` or ``TERM`` signal, **jack_mixer** will either
    exit the application immediately or, if enabled in the preferences, will
    show a confirmation dialog, allowing the user to either quit or cancel the
    action.
