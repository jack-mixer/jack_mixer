SYNOPSIS
========

jack_mix_box [-n <name>] [-p] [-s] [-v <dB>] MIDI_CC...


DESCRIPTION
===========

This manual page documents the **jack_mix_box** command.

**jack_mix_box** is a minimal, GUI-less version of **jack_mixer**. It creates a
JACK client with stereo output ports and a fixed number of mono or stereo input
ports. The number of input ports and the MIDI Control Change message
controlling the volume level of each is set via the command line. The signal of
each input channel is mixed into the stereo outputs.


OPTIONS
=======

Positional arguments:

    MIDI_CC...      add input channel controlled by MIDI_CC

Optional arguments:

    -h, --help      print this help message
    -n, --name      set JACK client name
    -p, --pickup    enable MIDI pickup mode (default: jump-to-value)
    -s, --stereo    make all input channels stereo with left+right input
    -v, --volume    initial volume gain in dBFS (default 0.0, i.e. unity gain)


USAGE
=====

Each positional argument is interpreted as a MIDI Control Change number and
adds a mixer channel with one (mono) or left+right (stereo) inputs, whose
volume can be controlled via the given MIDI Control Change.

Use ``jack_connect`` or any other JACK conmection manager to connect other JACK
clients or system ports to the input and output port.

Send a ``SIGUSR1`` signal to the ``jack_mix_box`` process to have the current
volumes per input channel reported to the standard output.


JACK AUDIO AND MIDI PORTS
-------------------------

* For each input channel, **jack_mix_box** will create one (if it is a mono
  channel) or two (stereo) JACK audio input ports. The input port(s) will be
  named "Channel <n>", where "<n>" is the channel number, and have an " L"
  resp. " R" suffix, it the channel is stereo.
* It will create two JACK audio output ports named "MAIN L" and "MAIN R".
* It will also create one JACK MIDI input ("midi in") and one MIDI output
  ("midi out") port.


ENVIRONMENT
===========

``LANGUAGE``, ``LC_ALL``, ``LC_MESSAGES``, and ``LANG``
    The first of these environment variables set to a non-empty value is used
    to determine the language(s) for loading gettext translation files. The
    value should be a colon separated list of language codes.
``LC_NUMERIC``
    The language set via this environment determines the floating point number
    format used to parse volume levels given on the command line and to format
    them in the output. If ``LC_NUMERIC`` is not set, its value is inherited
    from one of the language environment variables described above.
``LOCALEDIR``
    With this environment variable, the base directory for the gettext
    translation files can be changed from the default set at compile
    time, which is usually ``<prefix>/share/locale``.


SIGNALS
=======

``SIGUSR1``
    Send ``SIGUSR1`` to the **jack_mix_box** process to have the current
    volumes reported per input channel.
